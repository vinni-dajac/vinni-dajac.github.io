A non-cooperation parameter was introduced to a platform for simulat- ing crowd dynamics in the North Avenue MRT platform during an emer- gency evacuation. The Social Force Model by Helbing-Molnar-Farkas- Vicsek (HMFV) was used as the basis for the interactions, while the A* Algorithm was used for the path finding. Simulations were done for val- ues of the non-cooperation parameter ranging from 0% to 50%. The total evacuation time was found to increase correspondingly as the non-cooperation parameter increases.
